# Pragmatic TDD

A pragmatic introduction to Test-driven development.

## Branches

There are two main branches:

* master
* fresh

Fresh is a clean branch. You should start here if you want to practice TDD 
using katas placed in the ``katas`` directory.

Try to avoid the master branch before practicing katas.

Except of that, there are branches specific for each implemented kata. Use 
them only to consult your own solutions. These branches can be useful if you 
want to "isolate" each kata from the rest. Each kata branch contains full 
commits history, so you can simply start from the first commit and go 
step-by-step to see all the changes as they were implemented. Currently there
 are following kata-branches:
 
* string-calculator
* stack-overflow

## Katas

See ``katas`` directory for the detailed description of all katas.
